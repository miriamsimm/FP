\section*{Introduction}
Lasers produce monochromatic light of high intensity and coherence. There are various kinds 
of lasers, such as dye lasers, solid-state lasers and free-electron lasers.
Today, semiconductor diode lasers are widely used as they are highly efficient, tunable, 
inexpensive and easy to operate. In this experiment, the 
functionality of a diode laser is studied and the absorption spectrum of Rubidium is measured.
