\section{Theory}
Every laser consists of three main components, the gain medium, a pump source
and an optical resonator. 
Stimulated emission in the gain medium amplifies incoming light. For these atomic transitions,
which determine the laser spectrum, it is crucial to create population inversion in the 
gain medium. This is achieved by the pump source, which constantly supplies energy.
The amplification grows exponentially with the travel distrance of the photons through 
the gain medium. Therefore the gain medium is placed in a resonator consisting of two 
parallel reflecting elements so that the photons can pass the gain medium multiple times.

\subsection*{Atomic Transitions}
In atomic transitions between different discrete energy levels the three processes 
absorption, spontaneous emission and stimulated emission have to be distinguished, which are
shown schematically for a two-level system in Fig. \ref{fig:transitions}.

\end{figure}
Spontaneous emission is the transition from a level of higher energy to a level of lower 
energy in which the energy difference between the two levels in released form of a photon.
If the transition is not spontaneous but induced by an incoming photon the process is 
called stimulated emission. 
Absorption occurs when an incoming photon causes a transition 
from the lower to the higher energy level and is absorbed in the process. 
In both stimulated emission and absorption the energy of the photon must correspond to the energy 
difference of the two energy levels.

Since the number of photons doubles in stimulated emission, light is amplified when 
stimulated emission occurs more often than spontaneous emission, for which population inversion
is necessary. Population inversion is created by the pump source that adds energy to the 
system and thus increases the occupation probability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
Population inversion is not possible in a two-level system where only an equal occupation of 
both levels can be achieved because of the short relaxation time due to spontaneous emission.
Therefore at least three levels are needed. In this case, absorption occurs between the first (lowest)
and the third (highest) level, $E_1 \rightarrow E_3$. If the relaxation time of $E_3$ is 
much shorter than the relaxation time of $E_2$, a population inversion between the levels 
$E_1$ and $E_2$ is realised.

\subsection*{Diode Lasers}
In a diode laser is semiconductor is used as the medium and a electric current is used as a 
pump source. Light is emitted due to recombination of electron-hole pairs at the p-n-junction.
The wavelength of the resonator corresponds to the band gap of the material.
Two parallel layers of the medium, one of the only partially reflecting, function as the 
resonator, or internal cavity.
